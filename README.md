# cst-tutorial-babybot
This repository provides a complete and reproducible Docker-based environment for training and integrating infant behavior models using the CST (Cognitive System Toolkit). It was developed as part of a tutorial presented at the ICDL (International Conference on Development and Learning).

## üß† Project Overview

This repository provides a complete and reproducible Docker-based environment for training and integrating infant behavior models using the CST (Cognitive System Toolkit). It was developed as part of a tutorial presented at the ICDL (International Conference on Development and Learning).

The environment supports:

Multimodal infant modeling with MIMo

Behavioral learning experiments using the BabyBench benchmark

Integration of cognitive models written in Java (CST) with simulation environments

A lightweight graphical interface accessible via web browser (noVNC)



## ‚úÖ Requirements

This project runs entirely inside a Docker container, so the requirements are minimal on your host system.

### üß± Host System Requirements

These are required **only on your local machine** to build and run the Docker container.

| Requirement              | Recommended Version                 | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker**               | 20.10+                              | To build and run the development environment            |
| **Operating System**     | Linux / macOS / Windows (with WSL2) | Linux or WSL2 is recommended for smoother support       |
| **Web Browser**          | Any (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)         | To access the graphical interface via noVNC (port 8080) |
| **Git**                  | 2.x                                 | To clone BabyBench and MIMo repositories (optional)     |
| **CPU with AVX support** | Yes                                 | Recommended for PyTorch performance (MIMo models)       |
